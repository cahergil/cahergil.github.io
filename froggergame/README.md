# Memory Game Project

This is the third project of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. The task was to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger with provided visual assets and a game loop engine by adding a number of entities to the game including player characters, enemies and collectable items. The technologies used for the project are the following:
- Object Oriented JavaScript
- Css3
- Html5 & canvas

## How to play

Use the arrow keys; up, right, down, left to move the hero. The player starts with 6 lives, each collision with a bug reduces the number of lives by one and the hero will be positioned at the start point. The capture of a gem gives the player 200 points. As the hero reaches the water, it gets 100 points, go to the initial position,new gems are layed out on the canvas, and the level increases by 1. New bugs are added to the game as the user passes levels, increasing thus the difficulty of the game.
